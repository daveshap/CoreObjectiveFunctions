Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Issue with older coworker who is set in their ways…
Context: we process payments/we do accounting at our company

For whatever reason my older colleague doesn’t update employees about the progress of their reimbursements until it’s completely finished. This leads to folks coming to me asking if I can reach out to her to see if they can get an update. Most recently I sent her an FYI email just saying that they were waiting for her to contact them as they wanted to know the status. She emails me back saying, “…I am working on it. I will reach out to them when it’s complete.” She’s about two decades older than me (I’m in my late twenties) and maybe it’s an older person thing but I think it’s more professional to give updates over making people wait around wondering how far you’ve progressed on something… right? Unless I’ve set a specific due date, I would provide a status update in this case. Example of how I do things:

- You need this done by 12/10? Great, I will set a deadline for myself for 12/8 at the latest but will reach out to you sooner if I complete it before then. Sound good? Good!
- If no due date is set or it’s difficult to set a due date than I send an update any time progress is made and people never reach out to me in the meantime because I’ve set the precedent that I will communicate when I actually have updates.  

But, as far as I know, when someone emails her with a task, she doesn’t respond to it, she just starts working on it and will message them when it’s done (even if that means radio silence on her end for a few days to a week or more). No notice that she’s received the email or that she’s working on it. No estimated deadline given so that they have an idea of when to expect it to be completed…

I guess what’s frustrating is that this work style of hers bleeds into my day when folks come to me looking for updates. Then I have to spend my time pulling teeth trying to get some info from her. Does anyone have any advice for what I can do in this situation? I get along with her really well and I’ve never brought this up before because 1) I don’t want to make things awkward or ruin our rapport 2) she’s older than me so I don’t want to come across as the young know-it-all who’s trying to change her ways or say her way of doing things is wrong and I’m right la la la. 

It’s just really annoying cause to me it seems so simple to just quickly create a deadline and let them know or send a quick note (email/slack message) when there’s progress/updates.

If you read this far- thanks! 😅

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
- Setting a due date for oneself and then reaching out to the person with updates, or sending updates whenever progress is made
- Sending a note or email when there is progress or an update, regardless of due date

Totally not drinking alone in my room right now before sleeping
Anyway, here's Do You Remember by The Kinks

Walter

Remember when the world was young and all the girls knew Walter's name?

Walter

Isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?

Do you remember, Walter

Playing cricket in the thunder and the rain?

Do you remember, Walter

Smoking cigarettes behind your garden gate?

Yes, Walter was my mate

But Walter, my old friend, where are you now?


Walter's name

Walter

Isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?

Do you remember, Walter, how we said we'd fight the world so we'd be free?

We'd save up all our money and we'd buy a boat and sail away to sea

But it was not to be

I knew you then, but do I know you now?



Walter

You are just an echo of a world I knew so long ago

Walter

If you saw me now you wouldn't even know my name

I bet you're fat and married and you're always home in bed by half-past eight

And if I talked about the old times, you'd get bored and you'd have nothing more to say

(Emphasis on the following, very based)

Yes, people often change

But memories of people can remain

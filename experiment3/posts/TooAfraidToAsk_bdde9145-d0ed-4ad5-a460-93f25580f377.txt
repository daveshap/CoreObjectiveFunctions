How do you feel about women proposing to men?
This is my first Reddit post. Please be nice. ❤️

We’ve been together for a few years now. We’re absolutely in love and have all the same life goals and moral beliefs. 

I have been married once before and when we first got together I made it clear I didn’t want to get married again. My mind started to change about a year ago and i told him i wanted to marry him one day. He was happy and said he felt the same way. 

Christmas is coming and I’ve been thinking about getting him a ring and proposing. My question here is - guys, how would you feel about getting proposed to? And have any ladies here proposed? What was your experience like?

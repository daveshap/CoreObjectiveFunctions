Describe your symptoms.
I am a hip hop producer who has suffered with DR since I was 14. I’m 40 now. I am working on a song with an established artist and it is going to be about derealisation. I’m struggling to put it all into words for him to be able to write the song. I’d like to make sure I get some all encompassing descriptions over to him. Thanks 🙏

Historic Youtube Channels List (Updated December 2021)
Historic Youtube Channels List by I_Saw_A_Bear (Updated December 2021)

Since this is a frequently asked question on r/History I’ve decided to put together this list of Youtube channels focused on History. This list is likely to be outdated or incomplete due to the vastness of Youtube but hopefully it helps. Note; I put strong emphasis on channels with their sources listed and channels that post regularly and focus primarily on history.

Legend:

(A) = Academia. Run by, or invites academics in the field to come discuss topics.

(/) = Sources Hinted or Mentioned but Not Listed. Channels that mention or hint at their sources but don’t actually make a proper list or provide relevant links.

(S) = Provided Sources. Channels that cite or list their sources (or reference them directly in the video). These may also include link to google docs or amazon store pages were the sources are listed (because the channels need money somehow).

(0) = No Sources Listed. Channels that don’t meet these may or are still valued as discussion platforms. Also some channels may have started without listing source but now currently do.

**Animated Maps** This movement mainly started out for “battle map” channels, likely inspired from gaming since maps are just a good way to show information, though channels have begun venture beyond battles:

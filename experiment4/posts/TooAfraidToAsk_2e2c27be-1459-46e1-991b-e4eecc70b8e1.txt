How can I anonymously report a seemingly dangerous sex offender for moving 50-100 yards from a school?
My parents sold their house about a year and a half ago to an older man and woman. They seemed a little off but were enthusiastic about the house and didn’t try to lowball us. So a few paper signings and boxes later the house is now in their name. 
Fast forward to now and I’m bored playing around with my spyfly membership and see their old address pop up on the local sex offender finder with the older man’s name attached. I do some more research and realize this guy has the longest criminal record I’ve ever seen. I told my parents but our relationship is spotty and they didn’t take me seriously. 
My little brother and little sister go to the school directly in front of his house. The breeze way for the school that goes under the highway pops out about 20ft from his front door. Who do I contact to get him removed? And keep me and my family safe from a possible back lash?

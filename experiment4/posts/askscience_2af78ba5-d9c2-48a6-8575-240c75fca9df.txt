How did omicron get *50*mutations? Would this happen in one host or would 1 or 2 mutations happen in one person and that transmitted just a bit better than delta?
In other words….you’ve got the delta variant, which I assume is the variant omicron has fifty different mutations from? (Or is it 50 compared to the original?) 

Anyhow, person A has Delta. Does delta gain 50 mutations in person A, and so it transmits more and got to person B? Or does it develop 1-2 mutations reproducing in A, and go to B and mutate a few ways, then C?

How many mutations can occur in an individual host? 

And, how many mutations would omicron need to become another variant that’s being tracked by authorities as a new thing? I’d assume just one if that one meant it travelled more successfully than omicron? 

Finally, let’s say we think of It like vehicles. Is this more like the Ford E350 where it can a bus or fire truck or ambulance or FedEx depending on what back you put on, but the core truck is the same? Or is more like a Toyota where each model broke off from another model by becoming roomier or sportier or fancier?

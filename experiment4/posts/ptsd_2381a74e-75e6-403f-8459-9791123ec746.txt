is anyone else tired of hearing that their abusers will “get karma”
karma is a false hope. everyone that has harmed me seems to be living fine lives. no disturbance whatsoever. i’m still here and stressed from all of the shit i’ve been through, i can only find temporary relief. i’m tense all of the time and my abusers seem to be fine. years have passed and i’m getting worse, what even is healing, all i can hope for is normalcy. they have normalcy, i’m losing hope day by day, i’m not sure what even keeps me going anymore.
